- 🛡️ **Security-First**: Built-in security best practices (OWASP Top 10, auth patterns)

## Quick Start

### Installation

**Option 1: Quick Install (Recommended)**
```bash
# One-command installation via curl
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dsantiagomj/dsmj-ai-toolkit/main/install.sh | bash

# Restart your terminal or reload shell
source ~/.zshrc  # or ~/.bashrc
```

**Option 2: Homebrew**
```bash
# Direct install from tap
brew install dsantiagomj/dsmj-ai-toolkit/dsmj-ai-toolkit

# Or tap first, then install
brew tap dsantiagomj/dsmj-ai-toolkit
brew install dsmj-ai-toolkit
```

**Option 3: Manual Installation**
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/dsantiagomj/dsmj-ai-toolkit.git
cd dsmj-ai-toolkit

# Install globally
./bin/dsmj-ai install

# Add to PATH (or restart terminal)
source ~/.zshrc  # or ~/.bashrc
```

**Uninstall**
```bash
# Remove toolkit completely
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dsantiagomj/dsmj-ai-toolkit/main/uninstall.sh | bash

# Or if already installed
bash ~/.dsmj-ai-toolkit/uninstall.sh
```

### Initialize a Project

```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd my-project

# Initialize toolkit
dsmj-ai init

# This will:
# - Detect your stack (React, Next.js, Python, etc.)
# - Create .claude/ directory (if it doesn't exist)
# - Symlink relevant agents and skills
# - Generate customizable CLAUDE.md config (if it doesn't exist)
```

**⚠️ Safe with Existing MCP Configurations**:
The toolkit is **additive** and preserves existing configurations:
- ✅ Preserves existing `.claude/settings.json`, `.claude/mcp.json`, etc.
- ✅ Only adds `agents/` and `skills/` subdirectories
- ✅ Skips `CLAUDE.md` generation if file already exists
- ✅ Won't overwrite any existing MCP server configurations

If you have MCP servers already configured, they will continue working!

See [docs/MCP_SAFETY.md](docs/MCP_SAFETY.md) for detailed safety information.

### Start Using

```bash
# Start Claude Code in your project
claude-code

# The toolkit is now active!
# - Main Claude acts as orchestrator
# - Spawns specialists for focused work
# - Uses skills for domain knowledge
```

## Architecture

### The Vibe Loop

Our workflow follows this pattern:

```
Frame outcome → Scope change → Generate → Review diff → Verify
```

**In practice**:
1. **Main Claude (Orchestrator)**: Analyzes request, references skills
2. **Spawn Specialist**: code-writer for implementation, code-reviewer for reviews
3. **Focused Work**: Specialist works in isolated context with relevant skills
4. **Review & Verify**: Quality gates ensure code quality
5. **Return Summary**: Clear file references and next steps

### Agents (6 Total)

**Core Agents** (Always Available):
- **code-writer**: Implementation specialist - writes code only
- **code-reviewer**: Quality specialist - code review, security checks, runs automated tests
- **git-docs**: Git workflow specialist - commits, PRs, documentation, changelog

**Recommended Agents** (Most Projects):
- **planner**: Planning specialist - requirements gathering, architecture decisions, task breakdown
- **qa**: Quality assurance specialist - functional QA, UAT, accessibility, i18n, manual testing

**Optional Agents** (Specialized Needs):
- **devops**: Operations specialist - CI/CD, monitoring, publishing, releases, SRE

**Agent Usage by Project Type**:
| Project Type | Agents Needed | Count |
|--------------|---------------|-------|
| Backend API | code-writer, code-reviewer, git-docs, planner | 4 |
| Web App | + qa | 5 |
| With CI/CD | + devops | 6 |

### Skills

**Stack Skills** (auto-loaded based on detection):
- `react`: React 19 patterns with Server Components
- `nextjs`: Next.js 15 App Router patterns
- `python`: Python 3.12 best practices
- `typescript`: TypeScript patterns and types

**Domain Skills** (always loaded):
- `security`: OWASP Top 10, auth patterns, secure coding

**Meta Skills**:
- `context-monitor`: Detects conversation drift, suggests refocusing

## CLAUDE.md Configuration

The `.claude/CLAUDE.md` file is your **primary customization point**:

### Project Context (Prompt DNA)
```markdown
## Project Context
**Stack**: Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript, Prisma
**Current State**: Building authentication system
**Architecture**: API routes in /app/api/, components in /components/

## Goals & Auto-Invoke Rules
- **React components** → Reference react skill
- **API routes** → Reference nextjs skill
- **Security concerns** → Reference security skill

## Non-Goals (Anti-Patterns)
- ❌ Don't use client components unless necessary
- ❌ Don't bypass auth middleware
```

### Communication Styles

**Default**: Professional, concise, technical

**Maestro Mode**: Casual, friendly, with slangs
```
Activate with: "/maestro" or "use maestro mode"

Spanish slangs: ojo, chévere, dale, bacano, listo
English slangs: bet, lowkey, ngl, fr, valid
```

**IMPORTANT**: Maestro only changes communication style. ALL core rules and quality gates still apply.

### Core Operating Rules

1. **Git Commits**: Never add AI attribution
2. **Build Process**: Never auto-build, let user decide
3. **Tooling**: Use bat/rg/fd/sd/eza (modern tools)
4. **User Questions**: STOP and WAIT, never assume
5. **Verification First**: "Déjame verificar" before confirming
6. **Being Wrong**: Explain with evidence or acknowledge
7. **Show Alternatives**: Present options with tradeoffs
8. **Technical Accuracy**: Verify before stating claims
9. **Quality Gates**: Review → Test → Verify before commit

## Quality Gates Workflow

Before ANY commit:

1. **Diff Review**: code-reviewer analyzes changes
2. **Run It**: Execute relevant tests (when applicable)
3. **Edge Checks**: Verify error handling, edge cases
4. **Stop If**:
   - Tests failing
   - Security vulnerabilities detected
   - User hasn't confirmed breaking changes
   - Build errors present

```

## Progressive Disclosure

Skills use progressive disclosure to minimize context:

```
skills/stack/react/
├── SKILL.md              # Main content (~500 lines)
└── references/           # Detailed docs (loaded as needed)
    ├── server-components.md
    ├── hooks-reference.md
    ├── performance.md
    └── testing.md
```

Main content is loaded automatically. References are loaded only when needed.

## Customization

### What to Customize
✅ `.claude/CLAUDE.md` (Project Context, Goals, Non-Goals, Conventions)

### What NOT to Change
❌ Agent files (toolkit maintains these, updates via symlinks)
❌ Skill files (toolkit maintains these, updates via symlinks)

### Creating Custom Agents

Want to create your own agents? We've got you covered!

**Quick Start**:
```bash
# Copy the template
cp agents/TEMPLATE.md agents/my-agent.md

# Edit and customize
# See agents/GUIDE.md for complete instructions
```

**Resources**:
- **[agents/TEMPLATE.md](agents/TEMPLATE.md)** - Blank template to copy
- **[agents/GUIDE.md](agents/GUIDE.md)** - Complete creation guide with best practices

## Philosophy & Principles

### Core Beliefs
1. **Specialists Over Generalists**: Focused context beats knowing everything
2. **Quality Over Speed**: Verify before acting, review before committing
3. **Clarity Over Cleverness**: Simple, clear code beats clever abstractions
4. **Security By Default**: Auth, validation, and error handling are not optional

### Vibe Coding Principles (Integrated)
- **Director Mindset**: Orchestrator coordinates, specialists implement
- **Small Scopes**: Each specialist handles focused subtask
- **Verify by Default**: Check before confirming, test before deploying
- **State Discipline**: Clean context, clear summaries, no pollution
