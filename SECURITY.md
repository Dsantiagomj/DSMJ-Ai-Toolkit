### Please DO NOT

- **Do not** open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
- **Do not** publicly disclose the vulnerability before it has been addressed

### Please DO

1. **Email us directly** at: [your-email@example.com] (Replace with your email)
2. Include the following information:
   - Type of vulnerability
   - Full paths of source file(s) related to the vulnerability
   - Location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
   - Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
   - Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
   - Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours
- **Investigation**: We will investigate the issue and determine its severity
- **Updates**: We will keep you informed about our progress
- **Fix**: We will work on a fix and release it as soon as possible
- **Credit**: We will credit you in the security advisory (unless you wish to remain anonymous)

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 5 business days
- **Fix Timeline**: Depends on severity
  - Critical: 1-7 days
  - High: 7-30 days
  - Medium: 30-90 days
  - Low: Best effort

## Security Considerations

### What the Toolkit Does

- ✅ Provides AI agent configurations and skill templates
- ✅ Creates symlinks to global installation
- ✅ Generates local `.claude/CLAUDE.md` configuration
- ✅ Auto-detects project stack from package.json and other files

### What the Toolkit Does NOT Do

- ❌ Does not collect or transmit any user data
- ❌ Does not store credentials or sensitive information
- ❌ Does not execute arbitrary remote code
- ❌ Does not modify files outside of `.claude/` directory (except during init)
- ❌ Does not require network access (except for installation)

### Installation Security

The installation scripts (`install.sh` and `uninstall.sh`):
- Are hosted on GitHub and can be reviewed before execution
- Only modify `~/.dsmj-ai-toolkit` and shell config files
- Create backups before modifying configuration files
- Use standard Unix permissions (no sudo required)

### MCP Safety

The toolkit is designed to be safe with existing MCP configurations:
- Preserves existing `.claude/settings.json` and `.claude/mcp.json`
- Only adds `agents/` and `skills/` subdirectories
- Does not overwrite existing files

See [docs/MCP_SAFETY.md](docs/MCP_SAFETY.md) for details.

### Skills and Agents

All skills and agents:
- Are stored as plain markdown files
- Contain no executable code
- Are read by Claude Code at runtime
- Follow the Agent Skills open standard
- Can be reviewed in the repository

## Security Best Practices

When using dsmj-ai-toolkit:

1. **Review generated code**: Always review code generated by AI agents
2. **Don't commit secrets**: Use `.env` files and `.gitignore` for sensitive data
3. **Follow OWASP guidelines**: Use the security skill for secure coding patterns
4. **Keep updated**: Regularly update the toolkit for latest fixes
5. **Validate inputs**: The toolkit agents encourage input validation

## Known Limitations

- The toolkit relies on Claude Code's security model
- AI-generated code should always be reviewed before deployment
- The toolkit does not enforce security policies (it provides guidance)

## Security Features

The toolkit includes:

- Security skill with OWASP Top 10 patterns
- code-reviewer agent with security checks
- Secure coding best practices in all agents
- No credential storage or collection
- No network calls (except during installation)
